If we can pass a lot of these deals on to you, then it means we don’t have to go on the open market, so we’re happy to pass a large amount of the discount on, in return for a quick and efficient sale. We also want to find you a great deal – but why? Well for us, it isn’t about just selling a single property, we want to do such a good job for our investors that when you inevitably come to expanding your property portfolio, you think of us.";
